Installation
------------

The following has only been tested on macOS Mojave.

Clone this repo and run the installation script, which creates a
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment named `lsforce` and installs
the _lsforce_ package into the environment:
```shell
git clone https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/lsforce.git
cd lsforce
bash install.sh  # Or `bash install.sh 1` if you want developer tools as well
```

If you would like to compute your own Green's functions using a custom model, you can
optionally install
[Computer Programs in Seismology (CPS)](http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqccps.html) via the
following:

   1. Install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) with e.g. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
      ```shell
      brew install gcc
      ```
   2. Complete the
      [CPS license form](http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqc_cps/CPS/cpslisc.html), download
      the resulting archive, and unzip
   3. Move the directory `PROGRAMS.330` to where you'd like to install, then:
      ```shell
      cd PROGRAMS.330
      ./Setup OSX40
      ./C
      ```
   4. Add the executables to your `PATH` by adding the following line to your e.g.
      `~/.bash_profile`:
      ```shell
      export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/PROGRAMS.330/bin"
      ```

Documentation
-------------

Usage examples for the two currently-supported parameterization methods are given in
`example_full.py` and `example_triangle.py`.

To build the documentation, first ensure that you installed the developer tools (`bash
install.sh 1`), which are required for documentation building. Then:
```shell
conda activate lsforce
cd doc
make html
open _build/html/index.html  # macOS command to open file in browser
```

Testing
-------

Tests are located in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, first ensure that you
installed the developer tools (`bash install.sh 1`), which are required for testing.
Then:
```shell
conda activate lsforce
pytest --capture=no --cov=lsforce tests/
```
